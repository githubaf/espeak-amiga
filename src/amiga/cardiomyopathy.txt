Cardiomyopathy.  I had never heard of it before,
but there it was listed as the form of heart disease
that felled not one or two but all three of the
artificial heart recipients.  A little research
produced some interesting results.  According to an
article in the Nov. 8, 1984, New
England Journal of Medicine, cigarette smoking causes
this lethal disease that weakens the heart's pumping
power.  While the exact mechanism is not clear, Dr.
Arthur J. Hartz speculated that nicotine or carbon
monoxide in the smoke somehow poisons the heart and
leads to heart failure.
